                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Assembling and printing the hand: </h1>
                 <p> </p>
             	 <p> For this project, we 3D printed and assembled a pre-made prosthetic hand from <a href="https://3d.nih.gov/entries/3DPX-020258">here</a> </p> 
             	 	<p> </p>

                     <p> </p>
             	 	<p> My partner printed the parts with a Raised3D printer, which is the first time we have ever used it. The parts were all sized by 150%. The pieces printed beautifully. However, they were all printed with a base that proved itself to be difficult to remove. I think the base needed to have been printed with a bigger separation gap. I noticed other people in the class printed the parts with no base at all, and the pieces turned out great.  </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> Once we started connecting the pieces to one another we realized that the thumb and finger proximal phalanges had not been scaled up. Resulting in us struggling to connect them to the thumb and finger tips. The photo below shows how the holes in the tip and proximal phalanx did not line up correctly.</p>

                    <p> </p>
             	 <p> Luckily the class had extra thumb and finger proximal phalanges so we used those instead. Once we figured this out, the assembly process went smoothly. We followed a video tutorial that showed us how to string the fingers. Since the stringing had to be done while the hand was on an angle, I put the hand against my water bottle.  </p>
                 <p> </p>
                     <center><img src="StringHand.png" alt="..." /></center>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p>The most difficult part of assembling the hand was the stringing. I had the most trouble tightening the strings, so I think the tension of them came out a bit too loose. However, the hand still works. So, I think the assembly was successful.  </p>

                  <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Remixing the Hand: </h1>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p>For the next part of the project, we had to customize the hand so that it could perform a skill. I picked bike riding. </p>
				<p>  </p>
                <p> We had already been given an example of a piece designed for someone with a prosthetic hand to ride a bike. However, the user would have to remove their prosthetic hand to use it since it would not fit the whole prosthetic hand (the red part is where the hand would go).  </p>
                <p>  </p>
                    <center><img src="OriginalBike.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p>  </p>
                <p> The black part of this piece is what attaches to the bike. It connects to the red piece by having joints. So, I thought instead of having to take off the whole prosthetic hand, you could put the piece that allows the red part to attach to the black part to the actual prostetic hand. So, I downloaded the file from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2287054/files">this</a> and in Fusion360 I added the piece to the prosthetic handâ€™s palm. This way, the user could just place their hand on the bike. </p>
