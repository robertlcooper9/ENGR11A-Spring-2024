                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Print #1: Charmander holding a Heart </h1>
                 <p> For this project, we had to find at least two different 3D models online and combine them. I decided to find a pokemon and add a heart into their hands. Finding a pokemon model that would make this easy was a bit tricky since I needed one where its hands/arms were close together. I drew a sketch of what I wanted the arms to be posed as so that the heart would be easy to add. Since I knew it might be difficult to find a pokemon (plus I am not good at drawing) I just drew the arms with the heart instead of the full pokemon.  I found this <a href="https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/low-poly-charmander">low-poly charmander</a> that fit what I needed perfectly! </p>

                <p> TinkerCad already has a heart shape ready so I turned it and moved it into the charmanders arms. I found this whole process quite simple. Most difficult part was centering the heart because I do not fully understand how TinkerCads centering tools work. But, using trial and error, I got the heart to sit perfectly in the charmanders arms.

                <p> </p>
                <p> Unfortunately, after getting to about the charmanders knees, the print failed. As you can see in the picture below, the brims layers are too far apart.

                <p> </p>
                <p>I failed to capture a photo of this but, when the print failed it was very obvious this was due to it not sticking to the bed. To fix this, I decreased the brim separate gap and made the brim wider. </p>
                <p> Here is a screenshot of my settings after making the edit:</p>

                <p> This resulted in a successful print! </p>

                <p> </p>
                <p> Though the project ended up having some stringing, I still think the print turned out beautifully.  </p>

                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Print #2: Kiwi Bird with a Hat </h1>
                <p> For my second print, instead of using TinkerCad, I used Fusion360. Since the assignment was again to combine at least two things together, I decided to put a top hat onto a Kiwi bird. Here is my drawing: </p>
                <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="KiwiDrawing.png" alt="..." /></center>
                  <p> </p>
                <p>I got the hat from <a href= "https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-lil-hats-n-stuff-top-hat-33791">this creator</a> and the Kiwi bird from <a href= "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1917558/files"> this creator.</a> </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> After finding the pieces I wanted to combine, I loaded them into Fusion360 and was immediately very overwhelmed and confused. It took me way too long to figure out that to move an object you need to select Modify and then Move/Copy. I thought this was a lot of steps for just trying to move an object around. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Though I found it more complicated to move the hat around, I do not think I would have been able to get the hat in the most perfect position in TinkerCad as I was able to in Fusion360. Since the hat had a tilt designed into it, it was very important I was able to position it perfectly onto the bird. Having the hat tilting toward the beak would have looked odd compared to how I was able to get it toward the left side of the bird. I was also able to be more confident that the hat was actually placed on the kiwi bird and not floating through Fusion360 than I would have been able to in TinderCad. I feel this way because I found it easier to zoom in on Fusion360. </p>

                <p> </p>
                <p> After combining the hat and kiwi bird, I was ready to print. Here are the settings I used: </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="KiwiSettings.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Though I do think my first and only print of the Kiwi Bird was successful. The print has some flaws. For example, on the hat and front of the body, there are lines. I believe that these were caused by either piece wobbling or the machine because the lines seem to be consistent, following a pattern. The flaws are connected from each layer but slowly turn, instead of staying in a straight line. To fix this, since it is likely the piece not the actual printer, I could add a bigger brim. </p>

                <p> </p>
                <p> I still think it turned out cute and successful though! </p>
