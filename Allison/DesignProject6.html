             	 <!-- actual project-->
                 <p> For this part of our project, we are beginning to prototype a design to solve the problem we have defined.</p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Resources </h1>
                 <p> </p>
             	 <p> The resources we believe we need for this project are linked in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jggXgD1h9Pz74lPPZ1Hh-u_tCgPx0u0ALmFqtUNRgUI/edit?usp=sharing ">google document</a>. </p> 
                     <p> </p>
      <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Needs Statement: </h1>
                     <p> Blind dogs need a way to navigate so that they can be safe and independent.  </p>
                    <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Key Features of Product: </h1>
                <p> </p>
            <p><center> 1. Customizable Measurement —Something that extends past dogs furthest point on face (nose). → Measure specific dogs since nose size can vary from dog to dog even if they are the same breed. Include clear instructions on how to measure and what to measure.  </center></p>
                 <p><center> 2. Sturdy —Can stand force, does not move around too much, is not likely to break as the dog moves around. </center></p>
                <p><center> 3. Removable —if stuck on something can come off, will not choke / hurt the dog  </center></p>
                <p><center> 4. Comfort—does not cause too much discomfort, allows dogs to continue their way of life without the product acting as a burden, has a learning curve that allows dog to eventually use the product properly and comfortably.   </center></p>
                 <p> </p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Prototyping: </h1>
                 <p> </p>
                   <center><img src="HaloDrawing.png " alt="..." /></center> 
                <p> </p>
                 <p> Our first drawing was this. Our plan being to attach the tool to the dogs harness (a cheap/assessible item a dog owner may already own), we needed a way for it to fit. As well as it needed to stretch past the dog's head. Our plan was to tie velcro to the notches at the bottom of the item and attach that velcro to a velcro that was glued onto the harness. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="Halo1.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <center><img src="DogHaloSettings2.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We created and printed this as a quick fusion360 version of the goal. While it looked nice, it most certainly would not have been long enough to stop the dog from hitting its head on objects around it. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> So, we made it longer and reprinted it.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="DogHaloSettings.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <center><img src="Halo2.png " alt="..." /></center>
                 <p> </p>
                 <p>To test the design, we printed a dog and an item for the dog that wrapped around its neck (the part where the piece we created would attach to) to mimic a part of a harness. This step also allowed us to get started on how someone might have to tweak the design to better fit their own dog.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="DogPrint.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> Note: Due to the very small size of the dog model we printed, we did not tie the velcro to our design. Instead we used the stickiness the velcro came with and attached it that way. This definitely would not be sturdy enough for a real-life dog.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Since we knew we needed to use a material/design that was soft enough that it would not break upon impact but hard enough that it could warn the dog about an obstacle, we used a pull force scale to collect data on the force and displacement ratio. So, we clamped the halo to the table with a ruler to measure how much the material would stretch when we put force on it.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="ClampTest.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> This process resulted in us discovering that the PLA we have been using is too sturdy. Meaning, when hit hard, it did not have enough flex and as a result would hurt the dog. It also could break easily. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> To try to counteract this, we thought we should try making the design more squiggly. </p>
                <center><img src="HaloFail.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Sadly, the one print we had a chance to print failed. But, as you can see from the right side, it was much more squiggly than our original design. We decided to abandon this idea since one of our goals was to make something the user could easily customize for their dog and due to this pieces structure, we could not find a way to easily do that. </p>
                <p> </p> 
                <p> So, we decided to go a different route to try to fix this problem. Instead of changing our design we decided to change the material we were using. We decided to print with a softer material. Before we worked on our own design we printed an opensource halo from Thingiverse. This design had a piece that went over the dog’s head and as a result kept failing to print. So, we printed it with PETG. We found that PETG was too flexible for our goals. If our halo was too flexible, when it came in contact with a wall, it could flex and hit the dog. So, we decided not to use PETG. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Instead, we tried TPU. However, we struggled to find the right infill percentage. Too little infill resulted in not enough resistance to indicate to the dog that there's an obstacle while too much had too much resistance. We tested this using the same method as before with the PLA. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Here is the first TPU print we printed with 25% infill: </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="HaloInfill25.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <center><img src="PrintInfill25.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> This iteration had too little infill. So, it did not have enough resistance to indicate an obstacle for the dog. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> So, we tried to print again but this time with 85% infill. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="HaloInfill85.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <center><img src="PrintInfill85.png " alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>This print resulted in a piece that was soft enough that it absorbed impact without breaking but not too soft that it could properly warn about obstacles. </p>
                <p> </p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Summary: </h1>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We learned a lot from this iterative design process. We learned how to test the resistance of a material as well as more about the material TPU since we had to experiment to figure out the right way to print with it to fufill our needs. We also learned more about the limitiations of Fusion360 since we could not figure out a way to make a "squiggly" version of our design parametric.</p>
