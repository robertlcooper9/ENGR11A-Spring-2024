             	 <!-- actual project-->
                 <p> For this project, we are designing a tool that helps an impaired person or animal perform tasks that they would struggle to do without it. </p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Defining The Problem: </h1>
                 <p> </p>
             	 <p> The problem that we are working to solve is relieving visually impaired animals of stress that comes with navigating obstacles without hurting themselves. </p> 
                 <p><u><h3>Existing Solution #1:</h3></u> </p>
                    <center><img src="FirstDogHalo.png" alt="..." /></center>
             	 	<p><center>Image via <a href="MuffinsHalo.com">MuffinsHalo.com</a> </center></p>
                     <p> </p>
                     <p> An existing solution that is available in the market is Muffin’s Halo. Muffin’s Halo is made with water resistant vinyl tubing that has a gauge wire inside along with a cushioned wing attachment. However, the biggest issue with this product is that there is a high cost barrier (Costing about ~$90). This piece comes in 9 sizes. </p>
                     <p><u><h3>Existing Solution #2:</h3></u> </p>
             	 	<center><img src="SiennaActual.png" alt="..." /></center>
                    <p><p><center>Image via <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4733643">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4733643</a> </center></p> </p>
                    <p> Another solution is “Sienna’s Blindness Safety Hoop”. Instead of attaching to a cushion by the head, it attaches with some sort of harness. The original maker uses PLA. This design is much more accessible as the only cost (besides the 3D printer) would be the PLA needed to print it. It can also easily be resized to fit any dogs measurements.</p>

                    <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> The Science: </h1>
             	 <p> It is important we understand the science behind what we want to make before we make it so that we know what we can and cannot edit and why the similar devices we find are built a certain way.</p>

                 <p> 
                 The existing solutions we found help to prevent painful bumps from running into walls, furniture and other obstacles with a decorative halo to safely alert and redirect your pooch when she runs into a hard surface. They are both made to be lightweight, comfy and adjustable, but the design allows the force of an impact to be distributed in a way that does not harm the animal. In addition, Muffin’s Halo additionally uses cushioned wings to protect your dog’s delicate neck and shoulder area, and “Sienna’s Blindness Safety Hoop” relieves some of the cost border.  </p>

                 <h3><u>Potential Materials: </u></h3>
                 <p>PLA</p>
                <p>PETG</p>
                <p>Hard TPU</p> 
                <p>Nylon (easily breakable)</p>
                <p> </p>
                 <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Customer Profile: </h1>
                 <p>Our customer profile is owners of pets/people who work with pets with difficulties seeing. We can find potential customers through Tufts Veterinary School.  </p>
                 <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Open-Source Hardware Solutions: </h1>
                 <p> Next, we researched open-source hardware solutions. This was proven to be difficult as it seems the Miffys Halo is the most common solution and is what most owners with dogs who have difficulty seeing use. </p>

                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Key Features: </h1>
                <p> Next, we wrote up the key features our product is going to need.  </p>
                <p><center> 1. Detachable (If caught should be able to be detached)  </center></p>
                 <p><center> 2. Cushioned Back </center></p>
                <p><center> 3. Low Cost  </center></p>
                <p><center> 4. Visor Leveled—allows sight, going up stairs, sniffing grass, etc   </center></p>
                <p><center> 5. Allow eating… (Might simply have to take it off when they are eating or have a raised bowl)   </center></p>
                <p><center> 6. Recommend different materials for different dogs.  </center></p>
                <p>  </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Measuring Success: </h1>
                <p><center> 1. Tensile strength → how much you can bend it until it breaks. </center></p>
                <p><center> 2. What speed can it hit a wall with before it breaks? </center></p>
                <p><center> 3. And how far back does it bounce after hitting a wall? </center></p>
                 <p>  </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Collaboration Agreement: </h1>
                <center><img src="CollaborationAgreement.png " alt="..." /></center> 
                 <p>  </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Potential Ways to Solve the Problem: </h1>
                <p><center> 1. Get a guide dog for the guide dog  </center></p>
                 <p><center> 2. Halo attaches with harness </center></p>
                <p><center> 3. Attachable mobility cane  </center></p>
                <p><center> 4. Cane   </center></p>
                <p><center> 5. Mini portable fence (like a baby crawler)   </center></p>
                <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Design Thinking Methods: </h1>
                 <p> 1. Empathize—we talked through the problem and made sure to include humane features to our design that would allow the users to still be able to perform daily tasks   </p>
                <p> 2. Prototype—we talked through creating multiple designs and printing them out with PLA to slowly improve the actual design before printing it using our desired material(s). </p>
                <p> </p>
                <h1 class="fw-bolder"> Who we're working with: </h1>
                <p> We plan to learn from clients (Tufts Vet) and work to produce an open source hardware solution that people can print with a notes section of recommendations/tips. </p>
