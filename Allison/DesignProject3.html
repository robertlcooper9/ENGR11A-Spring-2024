                <h2 class="fw-bolder"> Project Overview </h2>
                <p> This projects goal was to solder a circuit board that would light up LED lights with sound. Afterwards, we had to create a 3D printed box and a laser-cut box designed in Fusion360 that would allow access to the battery pack as well as allow the LED lights microphones to be seen. 

                <h2 class="fw-bolder"> Soldering </h2>
             	 <p> First, we soldered the circuit board.  At first, it was rough. The board being so tiny made this task extra difficult. We did not want to use the magnifiers because they made us dizzy. We really like that you can see our progress by simply looking at it. </p> 
                 <p> Though, we do not know if we fried the circuit board so badly that it does not work yet, since we have not had access to batteries to test it. </p>
             	 	<p> </p>
             	 <center><img src="Solder.png" alt="..." /></center>
             	 <p> </p>

				<p> Once we finished soldering, we measured the circuit with the batteries. As well as we measured the height of the LEDs and speaker since those would need to poke through. This was a bit complicated because the length of the circuit board was bigger than the batteries. However, the batteryâ€™s width was bigger than the circuit board's length. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Here are the measurements: </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="KitMeasurements.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> When creating the box in Fusion360, we rounded up to the nearest mm in case our measurements were slightly off. For example, we measured the length as 64.84mm. So, we made the length of the box 65mm. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We planned to create an indented top so that the other part of the box could fit perfectly to it. </p>

                 <h2 class="fw-bolder"> 3D Printed Box </h2>
                 <p> To be able to easily access the battery pack, we created a lid and body using the fillet tool. This created a fitted lid, where the rest of the box should fit perfectly into.  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="3DPrintLid.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>We used the measurements we got earlier to create holes for the LEDs and speaker. We purposely made the holes bigger than what we measured. </p>
                <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="Whole3DPrintBox.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>When 3D printing, we printed the lid and bottom separately.  </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>For the bottom, we purposely printed it with the holes for the LEDs and speaker down. This way, the printer would not have to create a bridge, possibly resulting in a failed print. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>We also printed the lid from the bottom up for the same reason. </p>
                <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="3DPrintBox.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>After successfully printing, we noticed the box was not wide nor tall enough for the whole pack to fit. As well as the lid did not fit perfectly. We thought this happened due to us not accounting for the thickness. Luckily, we used parameters, so we added 2mm to the width and length and re-printed. However, we do not fully understand how the lid did not fit the box perfectly. Luckily, after filing down the lid, we were able to make it fit. Maybe the 3D printer simply was not able to be precise enough to make the connection perfect. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="FailedBox.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>After adding the 2mms, our second print was a success! We did have to file down the lid a little bit as the fit was still snug, but the circuit board and battery holder fell right into place and our design is functional for access to the lights, speaker, and battery. </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bolder"> Laser Box </h2>
                <p> The photo below was probably my third or fourth attempt at making the box. We got so frustrated with the video we were given that I ended up switching to another one, which we understood more. The box looks weirdly thick because we understood the depth of the box to be 2.5 cm while the thickness was 1cm. As a result, the box looks weirdly thick (I did edit the dimensions a bit in this screenshot so it looked less weird). </p>
                <p> </p>
                    <center><img src="MessedUpBox.Png" alt="..." /></center>
                  <p> </p>
                <p>Our next attempt went fairly well and smoothly. However, we only set the parameters for the width, length, and height. Not the thickness. So, when we changed them once again the box got messed up. As well as since we did not make the joints while the box was the correct dimensions, the joints moved strangely. As you can see in the picture they are weirdly close to one another.  </p>
                  <p> </p>
                <center><img src="OtherMessedUpBox2.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Eventually, we went to CAD office hours and we were talked through how to make the box. However, it still ended up getting messed up. We got confused about which notches were positive and which were negative, and somehow they stopped lining up. Because of the way the design process works, we had to restart from scratch again. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="OtherMessedUpBox.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Finally, after many failed attempts and many videos watched, we figured it out and got a decent looking box.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="Victory.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Next, we put the 5 separate walls into the lasers program.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="LaserCutPic.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> Note: The black lines are for the box we created. The blue were boxes other people in the class had already laser-cut. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>After successfully laser cutting, we were left with 5 pieces. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="BoxPieces.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p>After hot glueing them together, we were left with a complete box. </p>
                <p> </p>
                <center><img src="CompleteBox.png" alt="..." /></center>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Though the box was definitely successful, it is too tall for the circuit board and batteries. Luckily, this means we can still use it. But, if we were to redo this project, we would make the box shorter. </p>
