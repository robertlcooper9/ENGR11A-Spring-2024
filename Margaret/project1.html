                            </div>
                            <p>My first 3D project ever was a name tag key chain. The design was provided to us in a 3MF file. In order to print it, I had to download Prusa Slicer, configure it for the printer I was using, and import the file. What was really cool was the ability to edit the text on the keychain directly in Prusa Slicer.   </p>

                            <p> After I was finished editing, I exported the file as GCode and uploaded to a USB stick, which I plugged into the printer. I was surprised at how easy and intuitive I found the interface. I had very little issue selecting my file and getting the filament to load. I struggled a little bit when I had to switch it to the second filament because it purged directly on my print. Thankfully I was able to clean it up when it was done, and I am satisfied with the final product. I do wish I chose a larger font, and will keep that in mind for future prints.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>My second project was a double helix design that I found on thingiverse.com when I searched "torture test." This one was an STL file, but to be honest I did not see too much of a difference in user experience with this file type versus the other one. The print imported into Prusa Slicer side ways, and I had to ask for help to figure out how to rotate and level it. In the end, the base was not completely level but it was stable enough to stand. </p>

                            <p>The main issue I saw in the print was stringiness and poor bridging. There was some separating and messiness in the print. However, I am pleasantly surprised. I thought the print would fail more structurally- the design did not look stable at all which is why I chose it to test the limits of my printer.
