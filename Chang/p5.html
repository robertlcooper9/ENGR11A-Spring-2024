									<p>Before I formally introduce the project, I would like to talk about what inspired this project. During the course of Project 4, the idea of the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand caught my interest. It was a very inspiring design, as I had tendonitis in my hand in the past, I know how inconvenient it is not to be able to bend my fingers to grasp or hold things. However, I soon realized the limitations of the project: it is not suitable for users with a full hand. Also, in order to look more like a hand, the program sacrifices some of the joint's dexterity, allowing the user to make only a few simple gripping motions. </p>
									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Define Problem</h3>
									<p>We did some research on the real-world needs of people with such disabilities: </p>
									<p>The WHO provides a global estimate of 35 to 40 million people who require prosthetics. In the United States, about 35,000 people have amputations at the hand currently, and 0.009% of births are with an absent hand or fingers. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p5/research_data.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>For an estimation with a very large margin, using an estimated 4 million per year birth rate in the US, a current population of 336 million (U.S. Census Bureau), hand amputation rate of 0.02 per 100,000 people (Science Direct), there's about $$ {\frac{2\times10^{-2}}{1\times10^{5}}\times3.36\times10^{8}=67.2} $$ new cases per year related to trauma plus a congenital absent birth of 360 per year. </p>
                  <p>Then I thought of the possibility of designing a device for a wider audience than the e-NABLE Phoenix Hand, which would no longer be limited by whether or not the user has hands, and which could help the user with a wide range of daily tasks. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Existing Solutions & Mechanisms</h3>
									<p>There are many existing solutions for people with hand disabilities, most of which are a tool for a specific task. The e-NABLE Phoenix Hand itself is also a stand-alone solution in its own right for mimicking simple fist shaking motions. </p>
									<p>Though these solutions are easy to manufacture and use, they are not very versatile. It varies from solution to solution, which makes it time-consuming for the user to switch between different tools. Thus, the device we want to design is a general dock station that can be connected to a variety of tools to help people with hand disabilities complete a variety of tasks. </p>
									<p>Through a bunch of research, the idea of the modular tool system came to mind. The modular tool system is a system that allows the user to connect different tools to the same dock station. Within the field of manufacturing and construction, there are tools with interchangeable heads with varying functionality such as drilling, cutting, and sanding. This customizability aspect is a key aspect in what we want to achieve with our product. </p>
									<p>The dock station will have a variety of connectors that can be connected to different tools. The user can easily switch between different tools by simply connecting and disconnecting the tools. </p>
									<p>Besides, we also want a good way to attach the dock station to the user's palm. Surfing on Makers Making Change, we found a <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-fork-and-spoon-support-for-person-with-disabilities-5480#google_vignette" target="_blank">Fork and Spoon Support</a> that can be attached to the user's palm. The clip partof this device is a good reference for us to design the attachment mechanism for our dock station. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p5/clip.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>Another hand attachment mechanism we found is the <a href="https://www.activehands.com/product/general-purpose-gripping-aid/" target="_blank">Hand Orthosis</a>. This is a more complex mechanism that can be used to attach the dock station to the user's hand. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p5/gripping_aid.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>There is also an interesting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sammons-Preston-Pediatric-Customize-Individual/dp/B00BGZO10S/" target="_blank">Bendable Foam Handle</a> that can be used to hold long objects with the palm and arm. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p5/fork_support.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>As for the actual linkage mechanism between the dock station and the tools, we compare the pros and cons of different mechanisms in this <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2018/04/25/how-to-connect-two-parts-with-3d-printed-joints-and-snap-fits/" target="_blank">link</a>. We will fabricate some to make a final decision on which mechanism to use. </p>
									<p>Together with our dock station design, we want to also release a set of tools that can be connected to the dock station. </p>
									<p>Some general solutions we found are: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>A <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/bag-carrier/01tJR00000068yzYAA" target="_blank">bag carrier</a>. </li>
										<li>A <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/palm-pen-holder/01tJR00000068z8YAA" target="_blank">pen holder</a>. </li>
										<li>A <a href="https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/arthritis-typing-aid/01tJR00000092YrYAI" target="_blank">typing aid</a>. </li>
										<li>A <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2752083" target="_blank">bottle opener</a>. </li>
									</ul>
									<p>Based on the research we did, these solutions are just what we want to help our users most with. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Customer Profile</h3>
									<p>Though ambitious to design a product that can help a wide range of people, we need to narrow down our target users to better design in a short period of time. </p>
									<p>Our users: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>are individuals with one low mobility hand and one still functional hand. Their weak hand should has enough palm space to attach to the clip of the dock station. We would like to make our design fit individuals with upper limb differences as wide as possible, but this selection of target users will allow us to design efficiently. </li>
										<li>may still need functional wrist movement, but this depends on the mechanism we choose for our product. </li>
										<li>varies from children to elders. 3D printing scale can be adjusted to fit different hand sizes. </li>
										<li>struggles with daily tasks such as eating, writing, and holding objects. </li>
									</ul>
									<p>Instead of working with a specific user, we will be working with a general user profile, and we will be testing our product on ourselves. I once had tendonitis in my hand, so I know what limits the user may have, and what kind of tasks the user may struggle with. </p>
									<p>After the design is tested, we will post the design on open-source hardware platforms such as Thingiverse and Makers Making Change. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Fabricating Existing Solutions</h3>
									<p>Before we start designing our product, we would like to fabricate some existing solutions to get a better understanding of the mechanisms and the user experience. </p>
									<p>At this point, the two main mechanisms we want to fabricate are the clip mechanism and the tool linkage mechanism. </p>
									<p>For the clip mechanism, after discussing with the team, we decided to fabricate the <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-fork-and-spoon-support-for-person-with-disabilities-5480#google_vignette" target="_blank">Fork and Spoon Support</a>. </p>
									<p>As for the tool linkage mechanism, we will fabricate the annular snap joint and the ball joint in this <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2018/04/25/how-to-connect-two-parts-with-3d-printed-joints-and-snap-fits/" target="_blank">link</a>. </p>

									<p><image src="assets/img/p5/fabricate_ball.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>The clip turned out to fit the palm well; the ball joint locks tightly when the nut is screwed in, but the annular snap joint is a little loose and not appropriate for our design. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Key Product Features</h3>
									<p>After the research and fabrication, we have a better understanding of the mechanisms and the user experience. We have decided on the key features of our product: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Clip mechanism: the device has a clip mechanism that allows the dock station to securely interlock to user's palm. </li>
										<li>Modular tool system: the dock station can be connected to a variety of toolkits that have different functionality/usage. </li>
										<li>Easy-to-assemble: the device is easy to assemble, disassemble, and switch between different tools with one hand. </li>
										<li>Open-source design: the design will be posted on open-source hardware platforms such as Thingiverse and Makers Making Change, along with the guidelines for customizing toolkits. </li>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Success of the Product</h3>
									<p>As we are not directly working with a specific user, we will be testing the product on ourselves. We will be testing the product on the user profile we defined earlier. </p>
									<p>To make the testing result more visible, we will measure the success of the product in a more quantitative approach. We will measure the structural strength of our product, including the clip mechanism and the tool linkage mechanism. </p>
									<p>To be specific, we will measure: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>the force that is required to break the curved part of the clip mechanism. </li>
										<li>the force that is required to change the angle of the ball joint when the nut is screwed tightly. </li>
									</ul>
									<p>We will produce some prototypes after, so the one that is defined as the success final design will be the one that has the highest structural strength. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">1st Week Meeting</h3>
									<p>During the first week meeting, we tried out some Design Thinking Methods listed on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/toolkit" target="_blank">Enterprise Design Thinking</a>: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Need Statements: to make our target design more specific, we defined the need statements of our users: </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Our users need a way to complete casual daily activities that is immediately and readily accessible, easy to use(without directions), and to have our attachments be quickly attached on to reduce assembly time so that they can gain similar efficiency as individuals with two hands. </li>
										</ul>
										<li>Prioritization Grid: to prioritize the features of our product and the existing solutions we found, we used a prioritization grid to rank the features based on their importance and feasibility: </li>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Potential Solutions</h3>
									<p>After the first week meeting, we have a clearer idea of the potential solutions we can design. The goal mainly covers three aspects: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>How will the clip mechanism be fixed to the user's palm? </li>
										<li>What mechanism will be used to connect the dock station to the toolkits? </li>
										<li>What kind of toolkits will be designed? </li>
									</ul>
									<p>Some potential solutions we came up with are: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Clip mechanism: </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Keeping the original design that fixed by clenching the palm. </li>
											<li>Adding a strap to fix and fasten the clip to the palm. </li>
										</ul>
										<li>Tool linkage mechanism: </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Integrating the socket of the ball joint mechanism onto the clip part, and the ball part onto the toolkits. </li>
											<li>A joint that utilizes magnets in a "key" that can be fitted on a table or held in another hand to take out the latch, inspired by anti-theft retail security tags. Here is a diagram of how it works: </li>
											<image src="assets/img/p5/magnetic_joint.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/>
										</ul>
										<li>Toolkits: </li>
										<ul>
											<li>Bag carrier: do not need angle adjustment, so can be directly connected to the dock station. </li>
											<li>Pen holder: need angle adjustment, so can be connected to the dock station with a ball joint. </li>
											<li>Typing aid: need angle adjustment, so can be connected to the dock station with a ball joint. </li>
											<li>Bottle opener: encounter horizontal torque, so should connect to the dock station with a magnetic joint. </li>
