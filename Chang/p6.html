									<p>Track back to our last project reflection <a href="p5.html" target="_blank">Design Project 5</a>, we have already defined the problem and the need statements. The need statements are as follows: </p>
									<p>Our users need a way to complete casual daily activities that is immediately and readily accessible, easy to use(without directions), and to have our attachments be quickly attached on to reduce assembly time so that they can gain similar efficiency as individuals with two hands. </p>
									<p>The need statements are the foundation of our design. We will use these need statements to generate our design principles. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Design Principles</h3>
									<p>We have defined some key product features already, but after the first team meeting, we have decided to make the design principles more specific. </p>
									<p>1. The curved part of the clip should be sturdy enough. </p>
									<p>2. The clip should be easy to attach and detach. </p>
									<p>3. The toolkits should be easy to attach to and detach from the clip. </p>
									<p>4. All the attach and detach actions should be able to be done with one hand. </p>
									<p>After discussion, we decided to design each part of the product separately instead of designing every part at the same time, so that we can test on each part and give a complete design progress, making sure each part works perfectly. </p>
									<p>For this project, we will focus on the clip with the docking station. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Ver. 1 Prototype</h3>
									<p>Because the <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-fork-and-spoon-support-for-person-with-disabilities-5480#google_vignette" target="_blank">Fork and Spoon Support</a> project works well as we tried it out last time, we decided to further modify the design. </p>
									<p>Importing the design into Fusion 360, the original design looks like this: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/original.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>The slot inside the clip is for holding utensils, and we don't need it for our design. So I filled the slot. </p>
									<p>Between the ball joint design and the magnet key design, we chose the ball joint design as our final selection. The magnet key design will be stronger, but it is hard to make the product small, which makes it hard to attach to the clip and violates our design principles. </p>
									<p>Following intuition, I directly combined the bottom part of the clip with the socket of the ball joint. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/prototype_socket.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>In PrusaSlicer, my original thought was to print the clip straight up, so that I don't need to use supports for the socket part, which could ruin its thread. But printing in such orientation would make the curved part of the clip weak. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/not_print_upward.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>So I decided to print the clip in a different orientation: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/cam_1.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>We chose 50% infill and PLA as the material because it is cheap for prototyping and we are familiar with it. </p>
									<p>After printing and removing the supports, the clip fits the palm well: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/prototype_1_onhand.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>Though the thread of the socket is a little bit rough, the nut can still be screwed in and out and holds the ball joint well. I would say this was a bold try and it worked well. </p>
									<p>Next, we will test the force needed to break the curved part of the clip, also in the following prototypes, so that we can quantitatively evaluate if the design is improved or not and decide if the design is successful. </p>
									<p>Here is the video showing how we tested the clip: </p>
									<video width="100%" controls>
										<source src="assets/img/p6/test_method.mp4" type="video/mp4">

									</video>
									<p>By checking the video frame by frame, we measured the force needed to break the clip is about 37.4N. We recorded this for further comparison. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Ver. 2 Prototype</h3>
									<p>Learnt from experience of previous projects, I know that sometimes dig holes in the model can make the model stronger, because the hole will add extra "walls" to the model, which is stronger than the infill. So I decided to dig a hole in the curved part of the clip. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/prototype_2.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/extra_wall.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>Unfortunately, the hole didn't make it much stronger. The clip broke at merely the same force as Ver.1 prototype. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Ver. 3 Prototype</h3>
									<p>The CAD redesign for Ver. 2 prototype is not remarkably successful. This could be due to that the size of the product is too small, so the hole doesn't make much difference. </p>
									<p>So I decided to change some CAM settings to make the clip stronger. </p>
									<p>Printing the clip vertically, the curved part could still be weak in the bending direction. So I decided to print the clip horizontally. </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/cam_2.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>We can foresee that all the layers will resist the bending force altogether, which will make the clip stronger. </p>
									<p>After printing and removing the supports: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/prototype_3_printed.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>It turned out that the clip is much stronger than the previous two versions. The force needed to break the clip is about 59.9N. </p>

									<h3 class="fw-bolder">Ver. 4 Prototype</h3>
									<p>Now we are confident that our design and CAM settings are optimized, so we decided to change the material to PETG, which is stronger than PLA, but more expensive and needs more appropriate settings. </p>
									<p>The printing settings for PETG differ from PLA mainly in the temperature and the bed temperature. The temperature for PETG is 240Â°C and the bed temperature is 80Â°C, so it will be more dangerous especially when we are removing the print from the bed. </p>
									<p>After printing and removing the supports: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/prototype_4_printed.jpg" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>To our surprise, the clip is much stronger than we expected. Shown in the video below, the clip didn't break, only bent. </p>
									<video width="100%" controls>
										<source src="assets/img/p6/not_break.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										Your browser does not support the video tag.
									</video>
									<p>As this is the first time we are using PETG, we are so excited about the fact that the material can change so much in the strength of the product. </p>

									<p>After Ver. 4 prototype, we did a few more consistent tests on the clip, and all the measurements are recorded in the table below: </p>
									<p><image src="assets/img/p6/table.png" alt="..." style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; padding:1px; border: thin solid black; "/></p>
									<p>The prototype of PETG printed horizontally is the best one, and we decided to use this design for the final product. </p>

									<p>Throughout the process of this project, keeping reminding ourselves the design principles always redirects us back on track. They are the foundation of the design and the criteria for evaluating the design. </p>
									<p>Also, the experience of using different materials is valuable. We can see how the material can change the strength of the product, and how the material can change the printing settings. Still, we need to optimize the design before changing the material, the failure might cost more if we blindly change the material. </p>
									<p>Our plan for the next step is to design the toolkits and the docking station, and test them mainly on the stability of the ball joint mechanism. </p>
