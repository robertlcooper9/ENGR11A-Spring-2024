I am deeply immersed in the fusion of technology and human experience. My primary research involves pioneering sensory augmentation with Arduino devices, a venture that seeks to redefine how we perceive and interact with our surroundings. This innovative work extends into a unique dance project, where technology harmoniously intersects with human movement, exploring the uncharted beauty of sensorially enhanced dance.
