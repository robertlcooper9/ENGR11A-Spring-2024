        <p class="description-one"> For Project 6, my group and I were tasked to create four design iterations for our final project. This was to help flesh out our final design, as well as help figure out any mechanical issues </p>
        <a><image src="IMAGES/P6/P6Sketch.png" class="Stop1"></image>

        <p class="title-one">Iteration 1</p>
        <p class="description-one">The first iteration was simple. It was just a miniature shape of the ramp's appearance when extended. It was created in Fusion360, using the sketch and extrude tools. The idea was to visualize what the ramp would look like. The print was completed without failure; however, I had too many supports, which caused the ramp to break after trying to remove some of the supports. The ramp served its function and worked as a proof of concept for later designs </p>

        <p class="title-one">Iteration 2</p>
        <p class="description-one">For the second iteration, we focused on making a joint connecting the supports to the steps, allowing for rotation. We drew inspiration from the pins found on the Enable hand that would connect the joints of the fingers. Using a pin found on Thingiverse, we created, measured, and designed a hole system that would allow the pins to fit into the base while also allowing for the rotation of the pins in the steps and the supports that connected them. The pins were, unfortunately, printed on an extremely small scale; however, they work fine.</p>

        <p class="title-one">Iteration 3</p>
        <p class="description-one">We combined iterations 1 and 2 for the third iteration, creating a fully functional retractable miniature ramp. The whole ramp, aside from the pins, was modeled in Fusion360. After printing on the Prusa Minis and fully assembling all the parts, I was left with a fully functional mini extendable ramp. The only problem that occurred was the initial batch of pins was too large, so to overcome this, I printed the second batch at 90%. The third iteration works wonderfully, and represents a scale model of what our final product could look like.</p>

        <p class="title-one">Iteration 4</p>
        <p class="description-one">For the final design iteration, we needed a method to hold the pins and support beams to a wooden board while still being modular. My team came up with a threaded clamp design. The threaded clamp allows for rapid attachment to a board with quick disassembly. However, we still need to iterate further on the design of the clamp to make it more flush with a 1-inch wooden board so that the folding mechanism still functions. In the future, the clamp will be much wider and have 2 points of contact</p>

        <p class="title-one">Reflection</p>
        <p class="description-one">Overall, the groundwork for the final product has been laid. And I am confident with some tweaks that we will have a fully functional, extendable ramp. The final steps will be creating a PLA prototype, further refinement, and then a polycarbonate final product.</p>
