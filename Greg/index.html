                                    <p class="mb-4"> Pre-Print:My first project in ENGR11A was taking on the task of creating a successful 3d print of a nametag. Within the PrusaSlicer Software I selected the Prusa MINI+Input Shaper as it was the printer we had in the engineering lab. Using the software, I adjusted settings such as the scaling on the x,y, and z axis', the 20% infill, or the layer height. Proceeding this step, I sliced the STL file, exported the file as G-code, and saved it as a 3MF file.I then used the USB drive with this file and inserted it into the printer, transferring the necessary information onto the machine. </p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1nametag3.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> Printing Process: I then inserted my USB into the 3d printer. I first loaded the printer with filament to print the first white layer as shown(image 2). I followed up then with a light blue doing the same process for my second layer, which was composed of the letters of my name, the borders, and the logo. </p>
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1nametag2.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> Result: The result of my first 3d print was a success! I did not encounter any significant problems within the process or my final print. </p>
                                      <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1overhang0.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> Pre-Print: The second print in my first project was intended to "test the boundaries" of the Prusa MINI 3d Printer. Using the Prusa Slicer software, I browsed 3d printing databases such as Printables to find the print I was looking for. I had to take into account what specific shapes(models with irregular surfaces and edges) and sizes(height, width, length) would be outside of the reach of the printer's capabilities and what would be within them.  </p>

                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1overhang0.5.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> Printing Process: Within the engineering lab and using my prior knowledge in regards to what I did well in my previous print, I printed my first layer of a model called "Overhang Test" on Printables. Above is the image of this first layer, which turned out to be successful. </p>

                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1overhang1.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> Approximately 2 hours later, my "stress test" print was complete. However, the print turned out to unsuccessful near the finishing layers of the print such as the overhang angle, with many ridges undernearth and warping near the base of the print. Additionally, I encountered a lot of stringing and oozing between the overhang and the base, along with the lettering being disfigured. Reflecting back on this project, I thouroughly enjoyed the design and printing process and found it to be very intriguing. It causes me to wonder and make connections as to how the everyday objects you use everyday are designed and manufactured using this process but on a more intricate, detail oriented, higher level.   </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">In the second project, we were introduced to and learnt how to use Computer-Aided Design Software(CAD). My first CAD experience was with a software called TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD is a user-friendly, web-based tool intended for the use of creating 3D models. It is designed for beginners, enabling them to easily create and manipulate 3D designs without advanced CAD skills.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4">I was prompted by my professor to create a combined 3d design of two prints using CAD, proceeded by CAM utilizing the Prusa 3d Printers within our engineering lab. For the design of my first print using TinkerCAD, I had been recently inspired to create a combination of a key and wallet-style card holder. This was because of the urgency to use both spontaneously at any moment/time within the colege life of many students on campus, which is a problem that I had run into many times in regards to the immediate access of my keys and campus card. I decided to sketch out my idea, which is displayed in the image above.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker2.png" alt="..." />
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker3.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4"> Pre-Print: I then used Thingaverse, a public website containing user-created digital design files, imported my files into TinkerCAD, and dragged them as close as possible to the faces of each print. I also utilized the "view cube" to repeatedly check to make sure the faces of my two prints had adhered to each other. Proceeding this step, I then highlighted both and selected the "Group" tool which finally combined the models together. </p>
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker4.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4"> I then encountered my first issue in my CAD process with the adhesion of my combined model to the build plate. I noticed this after an alert within the Prusa CAM software, and had to go back into TinkerCAD several times to make sure this problem was completely resolved. </p> 
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker5.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4"> I then implemented the brim feature within the CAM software which allows you to have a 3d printed border that extends outwards from the edges of my print. Additionally as a preventative measure, my print was also printed vertically in order to account for the space needed for the card holder, or else there would be a high chance I would encounter problems like drooping. </p>
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1tinker5.5.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4">After finalizing my design and exporting it as an STL file, I prepared my model for printing. Using majority default print settings besides adjusting the dimensions of my brim, I exported the file as G-Code and printing my model using the PRUSA Mini and  PLA filament. </p>
                                     <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1bug1.png" alt="..." />

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1bug4.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4">There were no printing issues, and the print was a success!  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">**Remix of Project with Fusion 360:Modification/Innovation through Fusion** Developed by Autodesk, Fusion is a software that integrates computer-aided design(CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing(CAM). This program provides a platform for users to design. simulate, and manufacture 3d models. For my use, I "remixed" my prototype of a keycard and decided to address some of the issues I had when I had tested my design and the overall practicality of it.
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1fusion1.jpg" alt="..." />

                                     <p class="mb-4">Fusion CAD Process+Steps: I then proceeded with a series of steps using my knowledge of Fusion CAD software. I first imported my file from TinkerCAD into Fusion and went to the mesh file, modifying and converting the mesh from mesh to solid. I then went to the solid section within fusion and constructed an offset plane in order to not have to work on top of numerous, miniscule triangles when outlining my model. Following this step, I used the line and spline tool to outline the shape that I wanted, created a sketch, and extruded it to the top of the body. After decreasing the thickness of the cover(90mm) I join body connected the extruded body ot the original body.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1fusion4.png" alt="..." />
                                     <p class="mb-4">I then exported as an STL file from Fusion, and imported it into the Prusa CAM slicing software before finally printing.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/1buggy1.png" alt="..." />

                                    <p class="mb-4">The print turned out to be another success! I was satisfied with the result and did not encounter any printing issues. </p>

                                     <p class="mb-4">Final Reflection: Throughout the course of the entirety of this project, I noticed that I had encountered a number of more problems especially since this was my first time working with CAD software. My overall approach to this project was to approach it head on without much of a dive into how I was going to reach the goal I had in mind, which caused me to feel overwhelmed and limited in my skills at many times. However, I am overall really impressed with my thought/design process and the improvement of my printing skils! I think I am a lot more familiar with the Prusa CAM software and the physical printer as well, especially since I had to work through things like a clogged extruder, stopped prints, etc. I look forward to learning more about Fusion and being able to hone my skills so that it can be a tool I can use in the future!</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Preprint-Soldering Process:
For project 3, we were prompted to design a CAD box using the software of Fusion360 to create an enclosure for a printed circuit board. We were first tasked to solder components of a kit onto the main circuit board in order to create a device where the diodes(lightbulbs) light up when prompted with any type of sound. The intensity of the external sound would also be measured by the amount of light bulbs lighted up. Our first step was to set up our soldering stations, which included the solder, soldering iron, brass, desoldering pump, magnifying glass and the circuit board. We then proceeded with soldering each component including 11 diodes(longer side on the positive indicating opening), resisters, capicitors, transistors,sound sensor, and an integrated circuit. After we successfully soldered all of the required components onto the circuit board and attached the battery pack, we inserted the batteries to test out the electronic prototype we assembled. Although the LEDs were turning on, they were continuously flashing on and off with seemingly no connection to the sound sensor. There was obviously something we did wrong with our soldering process, but even after showing it to professor Norton who used a voltage detector and tested out various components, we couldn’t find the issue and eventually gave up.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Postprint-Soldering Process:
Luckily for us, since we had a kit for each person, we had also started soldering on another kit, and soon after the first failure we had completed the second. After putting in the batteries and testing, it turned out to be a success! Whenever any sound was inputted above a certain intensity, the diode light bulbs would move across in a linear motion until the noise stopped. A video displaying this is shown below.

                                     <p class="mb-4"> Preprint-CAD Design Process: After finishing the soldering process and verifying the board works, we took measurements of the dimensions of what the total circuit board should be, which was turned out to be 6.4cm (circuit kit length) x 4.75cm (max length of the battery container) x 1.5cm (height of both combined - since we planned to stack both on top of each other). We also took measurements of the circuit board length (2.5cm), speaker diameter (1cm), the distances from the right edge and bottom of the circuit board to the center of the speaker, as well as a top-down view photo of the board itself (for approximate locations of the diode LEDs). The idea was to have an enclosure large enough to fit both the battery container and circuit board snugly stacked onto each other, with a removable lid on one side for battery replacement and cut outs on the other side which show the LED diodes and sound sensor. Some of our sketches and thought process of how the design should look are below.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/1great0.jpg" alt="..." />

                                     <p class="mb-4"> After taking necessary measurements, it was time to design the box in Fusion360. We created a base box which would hold the components, in which we took each previous measurement and added 10mm (5mm for each side length) as well as an extra 0.3mm for fitting, which ended up as a 74.3mm x 57.8mm x 35.0mm box. Then, we used the shell tool which allowed us to hollow out the box, and set the wall length to 5mm on each side. Now that the box was an empty hollow shell, we could start working on the lid. We initially were planning on using this design (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:468917) but after converting it into separate bodies in order to modify the separate parts we realized that it was too complex and it would be better to just create our own design. Instead, we decided to create a new sketch and created a new body which would form the opening for our lid. We made this body just a few millimeters thinner than the width of the box so it would fit snugly, and extended it to the point where it would just reach the length of the box. After using the extrude tool and performing a cut operation, there was now a thin ridge which could hold the new lid. We created a second body that was slightly smaller than the ridge which we created (~0.2mm on each side for fitting) and the lid was finished.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/1great4.png" alt="..." />

                                    <p class="mb-4">Once the lid was complete, we started to work on circuit design on the bottom. A new sketch was created which would contain all of the required measurements, and first we decided to mark a rectangle in the center which marked where the circuit would go. To do this, we used the pre-measured length and width of the circuit and added 0.3mm to each dimension (64.3mm x 25.3mm). Next, we approximated the placement and size of the sound sensor and LED diode holes, which we did from measurements previously taken in class about the diameter of each and how far the centers were from the bottom and sides. We decided to use a large rectangle for the top LEDs, as well as two circles below for the sound system and 11th LED. Once the layout was complete, we used the extrude tool to cut through the bottom layer, and added two support blocks on the sides of the circuit to keep it in place. **Using extrude tool to create an opening for the lid**</p>

                                    Once finished and exported, it was time to print. We used PrusaSlicer 2.7.1 to slice the print, adjusting the size and laying the compartment on its bottom. 20% infill was used, with 0.2mm quality settings and organic supports for ease of removal. The finished print took around 6 hours and used almost 23g of filament, but when retrieved we were happy to find that the print was a complete success. However, removing the supports from the thin layer that was the lid was incredibly difficult, and ultimately we were only able to remove the larger pieces sticking out, which made using the lid much less smooth than it should have been.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/2new1.png" alt="..." />

                                    <p class="mb-4">*Updated Lid*
                                    Once finished, we realized that we had forgotten a handle for the lid, and it was impossible to take it out once fully inside. We extended the length of the lid, as well as shrunk it by around 0.1-0.2mm because of the supports making it difficult to slide the lid back and forth. Then, a second part was added to give the hand a place to latch onto, which was perpendicular to the lid itself. Printing was much quicker than the original compartment, and took less than an hour to complete with no issues.

                                    <p class="mb-4">*Post-print + Outcome*
Once we returned to class the week after, we tested the newly printed objects. The new lid fit perfectly, and unlike the original had some more room to spare and so could smoothly slide back and forth with an attached handle at the end. The battery fit perfectly as it should have, but the circuit board was too long, by about less than a millimeter, and only one side would fit at a time. Unfortunately one of our measurements were probably very slightly off during class, showing the value of precision and the potential for human error. To account for this, next time it would be wise to use more than 0.3mm to the original measurement, if we had used 0.6mm or 0.75mm to account for more error the circuit would have definitely fit and this issue would have been avoided.

                                    <p class="mb-4">*Laser Box Print*
                                    Our next task was to create a laser cut box by using a laser cutter that was in our engineering lab. We would have to use CAD design in AutoCADFusion to design the box, move it to a printer software Lightburn as a DXF file, and finally do a hands-on assembly process to piece the parts together. 
                                   The first step would be to comprehensively and meticulously design a box using CAD that would allow the sides of the box to interlock together into one unified piece. This stage allowed for piecing together the box's structure and dimensions. Fusion 360's user-friendly interface allowed me to effecively(also with the help of my peers/professors) create the model I had in mind, ensuring that every aspect of the design met the desired specifications. Displayed below is my design in Fusion which would have to be individually exported as a DXF file in order to be imported into Lightburn, a software application designed for laser engraving and cutting machines. I then proceeded with lining up each of the sides of my box in order ensure that I do not waste product and none of the objects would be overlapping as well.                                   </p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/popcorn2.png" alt="..." />

                                     <p class="mb-4">Once exported onto a USB, I then started the laser cutting phase, in which I would have to go thourhg many preliminary safety measures in order to ensure that the cut does not mess up. This was a reductive manufacturing process rather than an additive process, so the laser would be the key factor that would allow the intricate details to be identified and then cut. Additionally, I adjusted settings of the laser such as the speed set to 25mm/s, power at 100%, and the device to "Mira 9".

 <p class="mb-4">*The cut was a success! After interlocking each of the sides I adhered each side to the base with glue, with a finished laser cut box shown above.* 
    From thinking up the box design on Fusion 360 to gluing it all together, the whole process showed how digital design and hands-on work go hand in hand. This journey highlights how engineering blends creativity and precision. It's like turning virtual ideas into real things using laser cutting – a step-by-step process where each detail matters.

                                    <p class="mb-4">    Reflecting on this project, I felt this process from conception of an idea to completion was challenging due to how intricate and detail oriented I had to be, recording precise measurements and accounting for margins. Additionally, the project required to problem solve if you did make any of these miniscule mistakes, like in the soldering process with a disturbed joint or in general too much or too little solder. The CAD design phase with Fusion 360 also served as a challenge, with our first prototype not being able to fit both the batterya and circuit board. To problem solve this, it required remeasuring and redesign in order to fit both. This engineering design project exemplified the plethora of physical and technological challenges, and mainly the iterative nature of the design process where there are numerous modification and repetition.

                                    <p class="mb-4"> For project 5, we were tasked with printing and assembling together a working prosthetic hand. I first downloaded the required STL files from the NIH 3d(National Institute of Allergy and Infectioous Diseases) that were required to assemble a right hand. I then imported them into IdeaMaker, a 3d printing software, and then rearranged the pieces so that they were in align with the build plate.</p>

                                   Proceeding the rearrangement, I separately imported parts of the hand into PrusaSlicer, a 3d printing program. These pieces included components such as the palm, gauntlet, phalanx, fingers, and small pins that would connect the parts together. For the larger pieces, I chose to print them without support and I added a raft to the smaller pin pieces.

Once the hand was one assembled piece, I secured the joints of the fingers with rubber bands and threaded string from the string box, making sure that all of the fingers would be tight but not too loose with just enough tension. I also attached a rubber cover for the fingers which would allow for better grip when picking up objects. Finally, my hand was completely functional, with the ability to open and close by controlling the wrist/gaunlet! </p></p>

                                         <p class="mb-4"> Proceeding this assembly of my hand, we were then tasked with using Fusion, a CAD software, to create a modification of the hand. After brainstorming, we came up with the idea of adding on a pencil holder, which would be located above the palm of the hand for easy accessibility. After accounting for margins we aimed for the dimensions of the box to have a height of 25mm, width of  25mm, and length of 76mm. The diameter of the pencil opening would be 7mm.</p>

Reflection: In this project, the process of printing the required components of the hand, assembling it, and modifying a piece of the hand required a blend of technical challenges and precise decision making. We struggled with difficulties such as the arrangement of the STL files on the print board and numerous printing issues, but in the end we were able to fully assemble a fully functional prosthetic hand, which was rewarding and served as motivation for harder tasks!

                                    <p class="mb-4">Intro and Identifying the Problem:
                                    For our fifth project in ENGR 11A, my team and I decided to create a universal hand clip with attachments that would vary in fuctionality for everyday tasks. Designed for people with upper limb difference, we wanted to address the mobility-related issues they encounter with holding or gripping objects. This is a relevant disability within the U.S., with the World Health Organization that a global estimate of 35-40 million people who require prosthetics. In the United States, about 35000 people have amputations at the hand currently, and 0.009% of births are with an absent hand or fingers. For an estimation with a very large margin, using an estimated 4mm/yr birth rate in the US, a current population of 336 million (U.S. Census Bureau), hand amputation rate of 0.02 per 100000 people (Science Direct), there’s about 0.02/100000*336000000=67.2 new cases per year related to trauma plus a congenital absent birth of 360 per year. These statistics highlight the urgency to provide prosthetic solutions, especially something that is on the cheaper side due to the expensive prices of most prosthetics.</p>

                                                                        <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/limblimb.png" alt="..." />

</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Existing Solutions:
                                    In exploring existing solutions for engineering design projects, I drew inspiration from a variety of products tailored to assist individuals with upper limb differences in their everyday lives. 
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/activehands1.png" alt="..." />

                                    Among these solutions are the gripping aid for heavy objects, exemplified by products like Active Hands' general-purpose gripping aid, which provides a solution for holding various objects securely through adjustable straps(a). 
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/fork.png" alt="..." />

                                    Additionally, there are kit-attaching solutions like the fork designed to attach on the arm, which offers a practical solution due to the ease of use and secure grip.(c). 
                                                                        <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/rubber.png" alt="..." />

                                    We also drew inspiration from rubber bonds that are silicone grips, which offer a means of attaching objects to the palm of a hand.

                                     Push gloves designed to aid wheelchair use and hand-fitting accessories like styluses and peelers further demonstrate the adaptability of existing solutions to meet diverse needs 

                                                                         <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/pencil.png" alt="..." />

                                     Additionally, small item gripping aids offer inspiration for features such as holding items at different angles, though they may have limitations in handling larger objects or requiring improved accuracy (similar to our idea) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWweq5jKxIE). 

                                     These existing solutions collectively inform the development of our upper limb difference clip product, which aims to provide versatile attachments with different functionalities tailored to meet the diverse daily needs of users.

                                    Our Goal/Needs Statement: Our users need a way to complete casual daily activities that is immediately and readily accessible, easy to use(without directions), and to have our attachments be quickly attached on to reduce assembly time so that they can gain similar efficiency as individuals with two hands.

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/fusion0.jpg" alt="..." />

                                    <p class="mb-4">In the second part to our design process for our final project, we were tasked with furthering our design and bringing it to real life. Shown above is a picture displaying the design and modifying of each prototype until our final prototype. We decided to use two testing Methodologies to determine the efficiency and limits of our prototype. The first being testing the force needed to change the angle of the ball joint extender, and the second being the vertical force that is needed to break the curved part of the clip.


</p>     
<p class="mb-4">Addionally our team defined the key design principles to follow throughout the course of the project:



</p>                                

 <p class="mb-4">
-The curved part of the clip should be sturdy enough





</p>    
<p class="mb-4">-The attachments should be easy to detach and attach from the clip.

</p>      
</p>     
<p class="mb-4">-The universal hand clip needs to be easily detached and attached 

</p>                                

</p>     




</p>                                

<p class="mb-4">-The clip should be able to be assembled and disassembled with one hand.




</p>                                

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/portfolio/fusion1.png" alt="..." />
                                    The first step in the iteration process was to use CAD design with AutoCAD Fusion software to combine the hand clip we used in our first design a the lockable ball joint. This would allow our attachments to be adjusted and locked in place, allowing the user to have flexibility with their usage and secureness as well.

                                    After importing into PrusaSlicer CAM software we printed it out using PLA filament. However, I noticed that it was rigid and didn't offer much flex, resulting in uncomfortability when fitting the clip on your hand. I had also printed it out horizontally and there was some inconsistant extrusion even with supports.

                                     In order to combat the extruding issues, in our CAM resdesign process we decided to print our prototype veritcally. This modification in our CAM process allowed us to print without any resulting in any issues in the extruding step.

                                    We also decided to attempt a sole material change(without CAD) to use TPU, a semi transparent flexible material, to test the overall efficiency and if it would be fit for our design. However, the clip we printed to test turned out to be flimsy and not rigid enough to stay secure on a hand.

                                    In our last iteration process we tested out PETG, a material that has a higher melting point, but more flexible and stronger than PLA.(480 melting point). The material turned out to be very secure when fit onto the hand and an overall success!

Reflection:In this final process of the design project, we learned the importance of varying aspects of our design specifically material and shape. Repeated trial and error was continuously a factor we encountered, making sure each of our key design principles were adhered to and met. In addition we learned lessons such as the importance of flexability, adaptability, and perserverance through errors or roadblocks in our design process. We were tested with our abilities and limits with Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing. This was apparent in our decisions to vertically print the clip to avoid extrusion issues, testing materials like PLA, PETG, and TPU, and designing different joints so our user's tasks could be optimized and efficient. By extensively covering the varying issues our user could encounter, we were able to eliminated most of the issues our user could possibly experience through everyday use.
